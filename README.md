# M-USE

The Multitask Unified Suite for Experiments is a Unity-based project for developing and controlling behavioural neuroscience experiments. Full documentation, descriptions, and a web build are available at http://m-use.psy.vanderbilt.edu.

At present the suite requires the 2020.3.40f1 version of the Unity editor. We are rapidly working to fix this issue.
