# M-USE

The Multitask Unified Suite for Experiments is a Unity-based project for developing and controlling behavioural neuroscience experiments. Full documentation, descriptions, and a web build are available at http://m-use.psy.vanderbilt.edu.

At present the suite depends on an out-of-date asset loader (Trilib 1.9), and requires a 2020 version of the Unity editor. We are rapidly working to fix both these issues.
